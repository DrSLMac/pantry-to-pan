# From Pantry to Pan

## Introduction
 - When it comes to getting meals on the table, using this app will inspire your culinary senses and help you become the chef you've always wanted to be.
 - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.

## Technologies
 - Javascript
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - TDD (Mocha/Chai)
 - Fetch API
